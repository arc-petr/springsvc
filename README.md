# Spring SVC
This is sample (and simple) Spring Boot 2 service based on reactive framework. It is useful as sample application for experiments with build and release.

It is configured to use JIB and require to setup credential for your container repository. 

At the moment it has one unauthenticated method /echo which returns everything passed as query parameter
